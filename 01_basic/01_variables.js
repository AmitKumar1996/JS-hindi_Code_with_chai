===========================================
üìå DIFFERENCE BETWEEN var, let, AND const
===========================================

FEATURE                 | var               | let               | const
--------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE                   | Function-scoped   | Block-scoped      | Block-scoped  
RE-DECLARATION          | ‚úÖ Allowed        | ‚ùå Not Allowed    | ‚ùå Not Allowed  
RE-ASSIGNMENT           | ‚úÖ Allowed        | ‚úÖ Allowed        | ‚ùå Not Allowed  
HOISTING                | ‚úÖ Hoisted (undefined) | ‚úÖ Hoisted (TDZ) | ‚úÖ Hoisted (TDZ)  
GLOBAL OBJECT PROPERTY  | ‚úÖ Added to window | ‚ùå Not added      | ‚ùå Not added  

NOTES:
- TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone): `let` and `const` are hoisted but cannot be used before initialization.
- `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
- Best Practice: Prefer `let` and `const` to avoid scope-related issues.
